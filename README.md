### Starting the bot

Docker image from: https://github.com/DRSchlaubi/mikmusic/pkgs/container/mikmusic%2Fbot

- Clone this repo
- Run `docker-compose up -d`

# For developers

JDK is required it can be obtained [here](https://adoptium.net) (Recommended for Windows but works everywhere)
and [here](https://sdkman.io/) (Recommended for Linux/Mac)

**Currently you can only use JDK 16, we will migrate to JDK 17 as soon as Kotlin 1.6 becomes stable**
Please set the `ENVIRONMENT` env var to `DEVELOPMENT` whilst developing the bot.
Also set a `TEST_GUILD` environment variable, for local commands

If you are making any changes to the bots official plugins (aka the plugins in this repo), please run the `rebuild-plugin-dependency-list.sh` script first, otherwise your plugins won't be loaded properly
