bot.generic.legacy_commands.explainer=Due to changes in Discord, we had to make changes to our command system so this \
  command no longer works, starting with <> all bots will no longer be able to use message commands, therefore we \
  already changed the behavior of our bot,
bot.generic-legacy_commands.how_to_now.title=How to achieve this action now?

bot.generic.legacy_commands.customemotes=The emoji system was changed to work differently now, now you have 3 options \n\
  - `ON` - This displays our own emojis before the vote option name in the buttons \n\
  - `OFF` - This only displays the vote option name in the buttons \n\
  - `CUSTOM` - This works the same as `ON` but prioritizes the Guilds custom emotes over our emotes \n\
  You can use `/default-options` or specify the settings on each vote

  commands, just type `/` and select our bot logo in the menu
bot.generic.legacy_commands.inf0=Just use `/info`
bot.generic.legacy_commands.quickcreate=Now you can use `/create-vote` or `/yes-no`, if you want to specify the default \
  options use `/default-options` and simply leave the arguments blank
